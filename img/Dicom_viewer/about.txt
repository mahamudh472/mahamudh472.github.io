DICOM Viewer
Description:
The DICOM Viewer project was developed as a client solution for displaying and interacting with DICOM (.dcm) files. This web application allows users to upload a DICOM file and view the medical images and associated metadata contained within it. The viewer handles three-dimensional data, displaying multiple image slices along with detailed patient and medical center information.

The interface is divided into two main sections:

Image Viewer (Left Panel): Displays the medical images from the DICOM file, with navigation controls to switch between slices. The viewer also features a mega zoom functionality, allowing users to hover over images and examine details more closely. AJAX is utilized for smooth, uninterrupted operations.
Metadata Display (Right Panel): Presents the metadata from the DICOM file, such as patient details and medical center information.
